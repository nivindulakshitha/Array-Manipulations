# Array-Manipulations

This project includes a collection of practical exercises using arrays in C++. The exercises focus on sorting, hash table creation, moving averages, matrix multiplication, and image filtering. It is designed for students to gain hands-on experience with array operations as part of the **Programming for Engineers** course at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

## Features

- **Array Sorting**: Ascending and descending order.
- **Hash Table Creation**: Generate a hash table representation of an array.
- **Moving Average**: Calculate moving averages for an array.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two user-defined 2x2 matrices.
- **Image Filtering**: Apply a filter to a predefined 10x10 array (image matrix) and compute results.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Array Manipulation
- Store and process a predefined integer array.
- Implement the following operations:
  - Ascending Sort
  - Descending Sort
  - Hash Table Representation
  - Moving Average
  - Display Original Array

### Exercise 2: Matrix Multiplication
- Accept two 2x2 matrices as input from the user.
- Perform matrix multiplication and display the result.

### Exercise 3: Image Filtering
- Work with a predefined 10x10 integer array (`img`).
- Allow the user to input a 2x2 filter matrix.
- Apply the filter to `img` and calculate a resulting 9x9 matrix (`rarr`).
- Demonstrate results with example filter matrices.
